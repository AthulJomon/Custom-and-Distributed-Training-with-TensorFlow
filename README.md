# Custom-and-Distributed-Training-with-TensorFlow
Implementaation of a distribution strategy to train on the [Oxford Flowers 102](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102) dataset. As the name suggests, distribution strategies allow you to setup training across multiple devices. The current implementation is just using a single device in this notebook but will should also work when you have a multi-device setup.
